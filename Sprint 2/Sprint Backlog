In our process of picking features for this sprint development, we decided to utilize a top-down approach focusing on features that heavily rely on each other so that we can finish
specific features together. It also seemed that these features wouldn't be too difficult to implement as well, so that definitely helped our decision. We also included the create user account feature
since that's pretty close to being fully implemented but still needs to have a few things corrected. Overall we're trying to focus on a few features, but implement them as fully as possible, so
that we can create a sustainable pace and focus on incremental development.
