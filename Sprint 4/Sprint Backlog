Features:
	1. Compare movie lists with other users	 
	2. Generate suggestions for new movies	
	3. User interfaces must be attractive
	4. Be secure and protect usersâ€™ data.	

In our process of picking features for this sprint development, 
We chose to finalizes previous features from our last sprint as soon as possible so we can get started with the features that remain.
We chose the remaining features mostly on what we have left and prioritized the larger features to tackle first. We picked feature user interfaces must be 
attractive to be in the last sprint so that we have the main functionality implemented and we can make it pretty. We picked compare with other users
and generate suggestions to be in sprint 4 since they depended on other major features such as watchlist and search. Lastly we added secruity in the
last sprint as well since it is also dependent on other features such as login/sign up and other features.
