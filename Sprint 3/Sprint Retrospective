Meeting Participants: Kerry Meng-Lin, Jasmine Lee, Kevin Dong, Mohammed Alamgir, Andrew Gonzalez

What process aspects will be changed? Explain why this will address the problem?
1. For TDD, we need to make sure we need to wtite commit the test method before the method. We also need to make sure the naming convention is correct so
that the grader can find the test methods. 
2. For refactor, we need to make sure an authorized user is closing the ticket which is the owner of the issue or another team member who is assigned 
by the issue owner.
3. For coverage, we need to make sure we are getting full branch coverage on our JUNIT and JEST tests

What tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review feedback?
1. Search - finishing up year picker feature, little eye, and dollar sign (Acceptance testing and implementation)
2. Movie Details - fix acceptance test for scrollable actor feature 
3. Movie Montage - write acceptance testing for use cases
