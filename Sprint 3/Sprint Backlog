In our process of picking features for this sprint development, 
we decided to finish up the features from our last sprint as well as getting started with the rest of the major features. 
Our plan is to finish the majority of the important features during this sprint and then work on the finishing touches such as styling in our last sprint. 
Overall weâ€™re trying to wrap things up during this sprint so that we can create a sustainable pace moving forward.
