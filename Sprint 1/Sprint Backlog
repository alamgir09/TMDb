Features:
2) Provide Movie Details
7) Create User Account


In our process of picking features for our sprint backlog, we first decided to rank all of the product backlog based on difficulty.
This allowed us to see which ones are more difficult than others. Based on this we picked features that would allow us to get our hand's dirty
and familiarize with the tech stack we're using. So the idea is to essentially start of slower to see what the strength's are of the team members,
and then go from there. We picked movie details because believed it would be easier and than the other features since and a crucial building block for 
the other features. We wanted to also pick foundational features where the other will build upon. We also wanted to find a balance between selecting diffcult
features but also picking ones that were doable within the given time frame of our first sprint and also giving us leeway if we run into issues with 
setting up our project and installations. We are also accounting for the time it will take to familairize ourselves with our new tech stack and the getting 
everyone set up on their computers.
