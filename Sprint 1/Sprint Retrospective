Meeting Participants: Kerry Meng-Lin, Jasmine Lee, Kevin Dong, Mohammed Alamgir, Andrew Gonzalez

What process aspects will be changed? Explain why this will address the problem?
1. Split into more distinct teams (frontend, backend, testing)
2. Verify the process of writing test cases and commits, so we don't lose points
3. More strategically picking features so that member's responsibilities do not overly rely on another person's feature

What tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review feedback?
1. Authentication - login via username, separate registration page accessible via log in, check for duplicate username and email (backend)
