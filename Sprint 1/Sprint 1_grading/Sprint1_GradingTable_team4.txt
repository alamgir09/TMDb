| Retrospective            | 6.0/8               | The process discussion did not address process penalties in Scrum, TDD, Gitflow, and Coverage.  These need to be directly addressed.  The existing process improvement are nice, but do not come across as grounded in specific problems the group had since there is a lack of discussion. (-2) |
